# sql-calculator

This script displays crucial information about MySQL in the same way as [mysqlcalculator](www.mysqlcalculator.com)

It is *highly* inspired by [check_mysql_memory_usage.sh](https://gist.github.com/fernandoaleman/5e693838f82a6858c11a534acb0f98d5)

:warning: WARNINGS :warning:

Be aware of [mysql-maria-memory-calculation-usage-creep](https://superuser.com/questions/1411800/mysql-maria-memory-calculation-usage-creep):
_"tmp_table_size Should be included in the PER-CONNECTION calculations and not in the BASE_MEMORY calculations.
The *base-memory* variables are those that are listed above the max_connections
The *per-connection* variables are listed below"_

```bash
  key_buffer_size
+ query_cache_size
+ tmp_table_size  <=============================> /!\
+ innodb_buffer_pool_size
+ innodb_additional_mem_pool_size <=============> /!\
+ innodb_log_buffer_size
+ (max_connections x ( sort_buffer_size
                       + read_buffer_size
                       + read_rnd_buffer_size
                       + join_buffer_size
                       + thread_stack
                       + binlog_cache_size))
```

### Moreover for MySQL5.7 please be aware of:

* MySQL query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20, and is removed in MySQL 8.0
  _( Source: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-cache-configuration.html )_

* innodb_use_sys_malloc and innodb_additional_mem_pool_size were deprecated in MySQL 5.6 and removed in MySQL 5.7.
  _( Source: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-performance-use_sys_malloc.html)_

* The innodb_buffer_pool_size configuration option can be set dynamically using a SET statement
  _( Source: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-buffer-pool-resize.html )_

* This new feature also introduced a new variable â€” innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size
